"""
We can find a mother vertex in O(V+E) time.
The idea is based on Kosarajuâ€™s Strongly Connected Component Algorithm.
In a graph of strongly connected components, mother vertices are always vertices
of source component in component graph. The idea is based on below fact.

If there exist mother vertex (or vertices),
then one of the mother vertices is the last finished vertex in DFS.
(Or a mother vertex has the maximum finish time in DFS traversal).
