You are given an array of integers arr. Your task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays, such that each element of the subarray appears at least twice.

Example

For arr = [0, 0, 0], the output should be duplicatesOnSegment(arr) = 3.

There are 3 subarrays that satisfy the criteria of containing only duplicate elements:

arr[0..1] = [0, 0]
arr[1..2] = [0, 0]
arr[0..2] = [0, 0, 0]
For arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], the output should be duplicatesOnSegment(arr) = 1.

There is only 1 applicable subarray: arr[0..3] = [1, 2, 1, 2].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)

[input] array.integer arr

An array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1800,
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104.

[output] integer

Return the number of contiguous subarrays in which each element occurs at least twice.
